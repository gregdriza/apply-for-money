## Apply For Money 
   Alloy, 
   Thank you so much for the opportunity to interview. I had so much fun working on this project. 
   
   In this repo you will find an application which collects a user's name, address, email, and social security number and verifies this data through Alloy's evaluation endpoints. The application was built with React and Express with a little help from some other third party components (material UI, react hook form, lodash). Users can be approved, denied, or in Manual Review. If users are to be reviewed, their "Supplied" data will be put in the Manual Review table. Data which does not pass Alloy's validation will be rejected and an error will be returned to client.
